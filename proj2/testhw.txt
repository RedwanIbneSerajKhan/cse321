This is a simple test program to help you validate that your hardware
is configured correctly for project 2.

I recommend that you try one or two simple programs to make sure that
you understand the development environment before building up the
project 2 hardware configuration "permanently."

You can install the program by running:

make install-testhw

while your hardware is connected to the machine you are running the VM
in.  The LEDs will all flash when the device is programmed, and then
this sequence of LEDs will run once:

RED solid while GREEN blinks 3 times
GREEN solid while BLUE blinks 3 times
YELLOW solid while RED blinks 3 times
BLUE solid on

At this point, if you press key0, the LEDs will cycle one at a time in
one direction, and if you release it and press key1, they will cycle
in the other direction.  The directions (i.e. which switch is which)
doesn't really matter.

If this is how your hardware works, great!  If not, check to make sure
that your wiring is correct and if you get stuck, check with your TA.
